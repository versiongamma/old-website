# VersionGamma.com 
### Portfolio, About Site, and excuse to mess around in ReactJS
---

This site is currently deployed at https://versiongamma.com.
---

#### What is this project developed with?
This site is essencially pure NextJS, with help from the Material UI framework.

#### Why make a ReactJS site for essentially a portfolio?
Cause it's fun! Not really any more complicated than that, I just wanted an excuse to learn mordern frameworks. I could've made this as pure HTML/CSS/JS, but that would've been no fun.

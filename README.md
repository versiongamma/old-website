### Portfolio, About Site, and excuse to dick around in ReactJS
---

This site is currently depolyed at https://versiongamma.com. To see the site as it is developed, you can go to https://dev.versiongamma.com to see features and updates before they are pushed to the final deployment

#### What is this projected developed with?
This site is essencially pure ReactJS, with help from the Material UI framework. Most UI elements are from MUI, and any API calls are done client side with ES6 fetch calls, or from other React frameworks, such as react-google-login 

#### Why make a ReactJS site for essentially a portfolio?
Cause it's fun! Not really any more complicated than that, I just wanted an excuse to learn mordern frameworks. Doing university projects in Java isn't much fun anymore, especially when UI development is such hell in that language.

#### Why have so many unessecary features?
Sure, I don't need a dark mode, or the ability to sign in with a google account, or the entire site loaded in one web page, but what would be the fun in making something if all it amounted to was some images and text in a couple of html files? Plus, that last one means the whole page only has to be loaded once, which is nice to the user I guess
